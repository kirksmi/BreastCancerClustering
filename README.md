## Metabolic stratification of breast tumours reveals subtypes of clinical relevance
In this work, we identify three metabolic subtypes with novel ER-positive metabolic subtypes not reported earlier. This repository contains the code used for generating the metabolic clusters, as well as training a machine-learning classification model.
